OSI Model
The Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model) is a conceptual model to help visualize a computerized network. Made up of seven layers, it represents the distinct levels that make up an end-to-end computing system.
The Seven OSI Model Layers
The OSI Model is split into seven abstraction layers: Physical, data link, network, transport, session, presentation and application. You can think of the bottom one, Layer 1 (the physical layer), as the closest to the most rudimentary electrical connections. The farther up you rise, the closer you get to Layer 7 (application layer), which is the most user-facing category.
